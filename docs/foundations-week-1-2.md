# Week 1-2: Foundations of Physical AI

## Digital AI vs Physical AI ka farq

This module introduces the fundamental difference between Digital AI and Physical AI:

- **Digital AI**: Works with data, text, images, and virtual environments
- **Physical AI**: Works with real-world objects, sensors, actuators, and physical constraints

## Humanoid Robotics ki history

Humanoid robotics has evolved significantly over the decades:

- Early developments in Japan with robots like WABOT-1
- Modern humanoid robots like Honda's ASIMO and SoftBank's Pepper
- Current research in bipedal locomotion and human-robot interaction

## Key Concepts

- Embodiment: The idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment
- Sensorimotor integration: How robots process sensory information to generate appropriate motor responses
- Human-centered design: Creating robots that can work safely and effectively alongside humans

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- The fundamental differences between digital and physical AI systems
- The historical context of humanoid robotics development
- The challenges and opportunities in physical AI research
