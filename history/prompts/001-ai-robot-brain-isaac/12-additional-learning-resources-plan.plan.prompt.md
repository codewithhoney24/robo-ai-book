# Additional Learning Resources Plan

## Prompt Text

Objective:
Create a structured execution plan for "Additional Learning Resources"
supporting the AI Robotics Textbook modules.

Scope:
- Glossary
- Assessment Questions
- Troubleshooting Guides

Create:

1. Resource Architecture
2. Resource Structure
3. Research Approach
4. Decision Log (with tradeoffs)
5. Testing & Validation Strategy

Constraints:
- Constitution compliant
- Technology-agnostic
- Learner-focused
- No code-level instructions

Phases:
Research → Foundation → Analysis → Synthesis

Result:
Execution-ready plan without sidebar errors.

## Response Text

I have created a comprehensive implementation plan for "Additional Learning Resources" with the following artifacts:

1. **Research.md**: Contains key decisions about comprehensive resource structure, glossary structure, assessment question types, and troubleshooting guide format with rationale for each decision.

2. **Data-model.md**: Defines entities related to the additional learning resources including GlossaryTerm, AssessmentQuestion, TroubleshootingGuide, TroubleshootingStep, and LearningResource with their relationships and state transitions.

3. **Quickstart.md**: Provides a guide on how to use and contribute to the additional learning resources (glossary, assessments, troubleshooting guides).

4. **Plan.md**: The main implementation plan including:
   - Architecture sketch showing the relationship between all resource types
   - Resource structure with organization and content elements for glossary, assessments, and troubleshooting
   - Research approach using multiple educational and technical sources
   - Decision log with tradeoffs for different design choices
   - Testing and validation strategy for ensuring quality

I also updated the agent context with the new technologies and frameworks used in this plan.

## Outcome

The implementation plan for Additional Learning Resources is complete and follows the required structure. It includes all requested components: resource architecture, resource structure, research approach, decision log, and validation strategy. The plan is aligned with the project constitution and prepared the foundation for developing educational resources that support the AI Robotics Textbook modules.

## Evaluation

The plan successfully addresses all requirements in the prompt:
- Contains an architecture sketch showing the relationship between resource components
- Includes detailed structure for glossary, assessments, and troubleshooting guides
- Outlines a research approach with appropriate educational sources
- Documents key decisions with tradeoffs
- Provides a comprehensive testing and validation strategy
- Follows the constitution principles and constraint requirements
