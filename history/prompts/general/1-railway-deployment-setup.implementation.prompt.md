  ## User Input

  ```text
  $ARGUMENTS
  ```

  You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

  ## Outline

  1. Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

  2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
     - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
     - For each checklist, count:
       - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
       - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
       - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
     - Create a status table:

       ```text
       | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
       |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
       | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
       | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
       | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
       ```

     - Calculate overall status:
       - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
       - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items

     - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
       - Display the table with incomplete item counts
       - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
       - Wait for user response before continuing
       - If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
       - If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3

     - **If all checklists are complete**:
       - Display the table showing all checklists passed
       - Automatically proceed to step 3

  3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
     - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
     - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
     - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
     - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
     - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
     - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

  4. **Project Setup Verification**:
     - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:

     **Detection & Creation Logic**:
     - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):

       ```sh
       git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
       ```

     - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore
     - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore
     - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns
     - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore
     - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)
     - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore
     - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore

     **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
     **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology

     **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):
     - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
     - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`
     - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`
     - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`
     - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`
     - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`
     - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`
     - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
     - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`
     - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
     - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `Makefile`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
     - **Swift**: `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `*.swiftpm/`, `Packages/`
     - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`
     - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`

     **Tool-Specific Patterns**:
     - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`
     - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`
     - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
     - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`
     - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`

     **Connection**: All ignore files should include patterns for sensitive files like `.env*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`, `*.pem`

  5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
     - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
     - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
     - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
     - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

  6. Execute implementation following the task plan:
     - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
     - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
     - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
     - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
     - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

  7. Implementation execution rules:
     - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
     - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
     - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
     - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
     - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

  8. Progress tracking and error handling:
     - Report progress after each completed task
     - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
     - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
     - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
     - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
     - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

  9. Completion validation:
     - Verify all required tasks are completed
     - Check that implemented features match the original specification
     - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
     - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
     - Report final status with summary of completed work

  Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/sp.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

  As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

  1) Determine Stage
     - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

  2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
     - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
     - Route is automatically determined by stage:
       - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
       - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
       - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

  3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
     - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
     - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
     - If the script fails:
       - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
       - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
       - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

  4) Validate + report
     - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
     - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.

  I'll help you deploy your project to Railway. Let me first check the prerequisites and gather information about your project.

  I've prepared your project for Railway deployment by:

  1. Created a `railway.json` configuration file that specifies how to build and deploy the application
  2. Created a `Procfile` for process management
  3. Created a `requirements.txt` file with all necessary Python dependencies
  4. Created a `runtime.txt` file to specify the Python version
  5. Created a `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment
  6. Created a `DEPLOYMENT.md` file with detailed deployment instructions
  7. Created a `deploy_to_railway.bat` script for Windows deployment
  8. Updated the settings.py file to properly handle Railway's environment variables

  To deploy your application to Railway, please follow these steps:

  1. Log in to Railway by running:
     ```
     railway login
     ```
     This will open a browser window where you can authenticate with Railway.

  2. Navigate to your project directory:
     ```
     cd d:\ai-book-pro\ai-robo-bk
     ```

  3. Initialize a new Railway project or link to an existing one:
     ```
     railway init
     ```

  4. Set the required environment variables:
     ```
     railway var set COHERE_API_KEY=<your-cohere-api-key>
     railway var set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
     railway var set DATABASE_URL=<your-postgresql-url>
     railway var set QDRANT_API_KEY=<your-qdrant-api-key>
     railway var set QDRANT_ENDPOINT=<your-qdrant-endpoint>
     ```

  5. Deploy your application:
     ```
     railway up
     ```

  Your backend application is now configured for deployment to Railway. The configuration includes:
  - Using Docker for containerized deployment
  - Proper handling of Railway's PORT environment variable
  - All necessary dependencies for the FastAPI application
  - Database connection setup for Neon PostgreSQL
  - Vector store integration for Qdrant
  - AI service integration for Cohere and OpenAI

  Once deployed, your API will be accessible at the URL provided by Railway after the deployment completes.
