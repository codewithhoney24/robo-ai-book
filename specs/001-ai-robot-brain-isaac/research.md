# Research: Additional Learning Resources for AI Robotics Textbook

## Decision: Comprehensive Resource Structure
- **Rationale**: Students need multiple support resources to master complex robotics concepts effectively.
- **Alternatives considered**: Only assessments or only troubleshooting guides were considered but comprehensive support was selected for better learning outcomes.

## Decision: Glossary Structure
- **Rationale**: Technical terminology in robotics and AI is complex and specific; a comprehensive glossary helps diverse learners understand concepts.
- **Alternatives considered**: In-text definitions were considered but separate glossary provides better reference utility.

## Decision: Assessment Question Types
- **Rationale**: Different question types serve different learning objectives - conceptual understanding, application, and analysis.
- **Alternatives considered**: Only multiple choice or only practical exercises; mixed approach was selected for comprehensive evaluation.

## Decision: Troubleshooting Guide Format
- **Rationale**: Systematic approach to problem-solving helps students develop debugging skills essential for robotics development.
- **Alternatives considered**: Simple FAQ format was considered but structured troubleshooting approach better develops problem-solving skills.
